**Title: Introduction to Git**

### 1. Introduction
**Objective**: Understand the basic principles of Git and how it is used for version control in software development projects.
**Importance**: Git is a widely used distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with team members, and manage project history effectively.

### 2. Main Content
#### 2.1. Theory and Concepts
**What is Git?**
- Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects and keep track of changes to files.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Repository (Repo)**: A collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with their complete history of changes.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of the project's files at a specific point in time.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase, allowing for experimentation and isolation of features.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another, typically used to incorporate new features or fixes.

#### 2.2. Practical Examples
**Example 1: Setting up a Git Repository**
- Command to initialize a new Git repository:
  ```sh
  git init
  ```

**Example 2: Making Changes and Committing**
- Commands to stage and commit changes:
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

#### 2.3. Activities
- **Quiz**: Define the key concepts of Git (repository, commit, branch, merge).
- **Exercise**: Create a new branch, make changes, commit them, and merge the branch back into the main codebase.

#### 2.4. Additional Resources
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education)

### 3. Conclusion
**Summary**: Git is a powerful tool for managing project versions and facilitating collaboration among developers. Learning Git fundamentals can streamline development workflows and improve team productivity.

**Next Steps**: Explore more advanced Git features such as branching strategies, rebasing, and resolving merge conflicts.

### 4. Appendix
**Glossary of Terms**:
- **Repository**: A storage location for a project's files and revision history.
- **Commit**: A record of changes to a repository at a specific point in time.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of a repository's codebase, allowing for separate development paths.
- **Merge**: Incorporating changes from one branch into another.
